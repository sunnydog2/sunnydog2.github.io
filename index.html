</h1>

        <p>I just finished 3 months at Gainesville Dev Academy and it is already paying off in my career. Not only have I been able to transition to my ideal role as a front end developer, but my development confidence level is so much higher than it was before. 4 years ago, I went back to school for web design and development at a place of business I won't mention, but all I got out of it was basic HTML/CSS skills and proficiency with Adobe Creative suite. I could build an awesome landing page, but that's where my skill ended. Learning the MEAN stack is basically a requirement for anyone looking to get into front end web dev, and GDEV provided me with the best education I could have found. Being in a classroom setting (which I prefer) and having an awesome instructor paired with some self motivation gives you an A+ education! I recommend this to anyone in the area looking to become a web developer. </p>
